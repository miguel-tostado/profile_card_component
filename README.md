## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project helped me get into flexbox a bit more and relearn css positioning. Getting the different sections was also pretty important so I had to plan ahead to make sure each section was setup to help make using flexbox easier.

I also tried using CSS variables for the font and different colors. Seemed to work alright, but a bit excessive for this small a project. Still, good practice!

### Continued development

I definitely need to get better at positioning - it took a bit longer than I had hoped to get everything setup properly.

Use CSS variables more.
